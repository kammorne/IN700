	<h4>Semester Summary (Project 2)</h4>
	
	<p>This semester was definitely one of the more involving ones I've taken part in, and I'm glad that I had the team we had this semester.</p>
	
	<p>To put it bluntly, Last semester turned out really bad. Project One with our previous team ended up with us producing essentially nothing, and
	as I've stated to my group multiple times this semester, I'm really glad we did not have showcase at the end. This time however, I'm glad to say that
	the team pulled through, we actually got together and talked things out and had team meetings, and we actually ended up producing actual projects, even
	finishing a few! I'm glad to say that we actually began work on the Orokonui Project this semester, which apparently had been a project for the past 3
	years. This semester, we actually got the Web App for Orokonui going, even getting it live to the outside world with a proper domain name, alongside getting
	not just one, but TWO gate sensors out in the field out at Orokonui.</p>
	
	<p>So most of what I was working on this semester was fixing the Web apps we already had, alongside other Web Development type jobs. I didn't mind this, as
		I really enjoy working with the web side of things, and this definitely was the semester to do these kind of tickets. About half way through the semester,
		we decided to change over from the MongoDB Database structure, to a more understandable MySQL Database run with MariaDB. Our reasoning for this was that we
		could employ more structure into the database, compared to a MongoDB one, it also meant that newcomers to the project would be able to understand the
		database structure more, since most students would have taken either Databases 2, or Web 2, which are 2 classes that employ the use of a MySQL database,
		meaning students wouldn't have to spend time learning how to use the Mongo Database.</p>
	
	<p>Overall, I feel like I could have done more for the team, as looking back at the work I've done over the semester, coupled with me disappearing for 2 weeks
	at the beginning, I realised that the amount of work I had put in was a bit disappointing, and I realised this late into the semester. Wanting to prove that I
	wanted to be part of this group, as well as prove that I hadn't been sitting on my ass doing diddily-squat all semester, I began taking on more tickets, some of
	which took me out of my comfort zone, such as learning to solder the CO2 boards correctly. In the end, I'm hoping that I've contributed enough, because although
	it felt like I was doing a lot this semester, there isn't too much to show, as most of it was bug-fixing and updating existing web projects, like the Orokonui
	web-app</p>
	
	<p>With Showcase looming closely ahead, I'm glad that the team managed to do so much this semester, and I'm a bit sad to have to leave the group, as it's been so
	much more fun this semester compared to Semester 1's Project, which didn't feel involving at all.</p>

	<h4>Semester Summary (Project 1)</h4>
	
	<p>This Semester, I've joined up with the Internet of Things Project group, which is comprised of the creation of 'nodes' for clients located around
		Dunedin. The nodes involved are small devices, usually created with an Arduino board (or a similar product, such as the Adafruit boards), andp
		provides different information, depending on the sensors that are connected, and what information is being sent from the node.</p>
	
	<p>Throughout the semester however, I've been more involved in the web development side of things, creating websites and a localized web app to display
		the different information being sent from the nodes.</p>
	
	<p>Originally, I ended up creating a website for one of our clients, Linus, to display the information being sent from the Temperature/Humidity sensor we'd
		created for him. This was a good learning experience, because I got to learn about the MQTT service, and how to connect to it using Javascript in order
		to get the information displayed in a readable format.</p>
	
	<p>I then went on to take on the task of creating a Database webapp for the group, which would display the different node's information for the last 12 months,
		rather than just the latest reading, like the website for Linus was doing. This has been an on-going task, as I'm still working on it at the end of the 
		semester. Currently, the web app is live on the Polytechnic network, displaying the latest 100 readings for every node. The future plans for the app
		include having Google Authentication, The ability to create and log new nodes, and possibly have graphs for some sensors to investigate trends.</p>
