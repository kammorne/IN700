	<h4>Semester Summary</h4>
	
	<p>This Semester, I've joined up with the Internet of Things Project group, which is comprised of the creation of 'nodes' for clients located around
		Dunedin. The nodes involved are small devices, usually created with an Arduino board (or a similar product, such as the Adafruit boards), andp
		provides different information, depending on the sensors that are connected, and what information is being sent from the node.</p>
	
	<p>Throughout the semester however, I've been more involved in the web development side of things, creating websites and a localized web app to display
		the different information being sent from the nodes.</p>
	
	<p>Originally, I ended up creating a website for one of our clients, Linus, to display the information being sent from the Temperature/Humidity sensor we'd
		created for him. This was a good learning experience, because I got to learn about the MQTT service, and how to connect to it using Javascript in order
		to get the information displayed in a readable format.</p>
	
	<p>I then went on to take on the task of creating a Database webapp for the group, which would display the different node's information for the last 12 months,
		rather than just the latest reading, like the website for Linus was doing. This has been an on-going task, as I'm still working on it at the end of the 
		semester. Currently, the web app is live on the Polytechnic network, displaying the latest 100 readings for every node. The future plans for the app
		include having Google Authentication, The ability to create and log new nodes, and possibly have graphs for some sensors to investigate trends.</p>
