# Concerning Ages

Ended up volunteering for Age Concern on Friday, although it didn't end up going anywhere. I arrived 2 minutes early after trying to find a park close by,
and went in. However, the office was locked and I couldn't find anyone in the building. I ended up waiting for an extra 10 minutes before leaving as nobody
showed up, and I wasn't able to help out.
