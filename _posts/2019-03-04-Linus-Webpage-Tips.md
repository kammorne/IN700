# Linus Webpage Tips

On Monday, I continued my work on the website for Linus, and began researching on how to get an MQTT Broadcast onto a website. After some searching online, I found a helpful
tutorial which ended up being created by Tom himself. After following the tutorial, I had the website recieving MQTT broadcasts, however it was receiving everything that was 
being sent through the LoRa server. After talking to Tom again, he provided some more assistance on getting the website to search for specific MQTT Broadcasts, and after some tinkering,
we had the website displaying the information from the temperature sensors.
