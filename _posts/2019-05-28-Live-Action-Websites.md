# Getting the Site Live

Had to talk to the dev ops team yesterday to organize a VM to host the IoT Data Webapp on, since we hadn't already organized one previously
when organizing the other VMs for our other projects. After a few issues with ticketing and getting information regarding the VM, I was able
to connect to the VM today, and organize the webapp.

I originally ran into a few issues regarding running the app, since I still had to install all the required imports for the app to work.
However, once I had sorted that out, I got the website running on the VM, allowing anyone within the polytech network to connect to the
database site to see the data.
