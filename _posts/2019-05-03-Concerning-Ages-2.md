# Concerning Ages 2: Actually Volunteering

Volunteered at Age Concern again, as per Kerri's request, since the people originally going weren't able to make it. I was given some more information about how to find the proper location this time, so that I wouldn't get a repeat of last time. After arriving and finding out what was going on, Nick and I sat down and helped a gentleman out with some issues he was having with his computer at home.
We spent a good 50 minutes helping this guy out, and he seemed very thankful for all the help we had given him when we were done. He did say there were some other issues he had, however he didn't have the time to go over them, since he had to catch a bus afterwards.
In the end, Nick and I ended up leaving at about 2:15 since the ladies in charge said that they should be fine, and there wasn't any more clients coming in that day. They were very thankful for us coming in and helping out.
