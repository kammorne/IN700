# Orokonui Trip 2

So we managed to organize a second trip to Orokonui, Horray! This time, we were installing a second gate sensor, as well as fixing the
current sensor that we set up last time, since we noticed that it was sometimes dropping packets, which wasn't ideal.

The plan was to go at 9am to try beat the weather, since the afternoon had thunderstorms forcasted. I unfortunately couldn't leave at 9am, 
due to a meeting with another lecturer, so I left as soon as that meeting was done. When I arrived, the team was down at the first gate still
fixing the issues. The fix in mind was just a larger antenna, as well as changing the spreading factor on the node, which gave us a slightly
better range, allowing it to send without the packets dropping. The main issue we encountered while working on this gate was the hole for the
antenna was too small, so a small bit of drilling and using the dremmel later, we managed to get the antenna to fit.

After the first gate was sorted, we moved down to the next gate we were going to connect. This one turned out to be slightly more difficult to
install compared to the last one, but we still managed to get it installed relatively quickly. This gate used a slightly different Reed sensor,
which was more exposed than the last one. After installing the reed sensors we gave it a quick test to make sure it didn't collide with anything,
(Silly, really we should have tested this before drilling into the gate with it, but I think we did this so we could make sure the sensor would still
say the gate was closed when it was). After the test, we found that there was barely a millimeter of clearance between the sensor and the gate, so we
decided to get out the trusty Dremmel and sand away a small bit of the gate so that it wasn't so close, just in case the gate moved at all in the future.

Once that was sorted, we attached the box to the other gate, mounting it with extreme caution and safety techniques in mind.

Once the sensor box was installed,
we made sure the wires weren't going to be an issue by covering them in heatwrap, and making sure the cables were tucked neatly away from prying Kaka eyes and
their beaks. Speaking of, we had one of them observing us most of the time, and even landed on Tony's head.
