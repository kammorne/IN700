# Python Webapp Switch

I've continued work on the database Webapp, converting the site from HTML to a python webapp, like what I'm currently learning in Web 3. I chose this as I found out from Tom that the data is stored
in a MongoDB database, rather than something like MariaDB, which I already had experience working with. Because of this, I've had to done a lot more research on how to actually connect to the database,
since I can't find any information in our repositories.
