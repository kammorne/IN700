# More CO2 Sensor Work

So Today, I collected the new 3d print for the CO2 sensor, since it failed last week. I just set it up to print and left it over the weekend.

Bad News, Bee told me that after we installed the new case, the CO2 sensor was giving bad readings, only going to 16ppm, which is extremely low.
She said she'd look into it, so I figured I'd start looking into different case designs just in case that was the reason. In the end however,
it turned out that it *wasn't* the reason, but we couldn't figure out why it was giving bad readings in the first place. Bee and Henry ended up
looking into the issue, leaving me tinkering with other tickets that were available.
