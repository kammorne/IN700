# New C02 Sensor Cases

So Today I wanted to tackle the issue with the CO2 Sensor cases, which wasn't really an issue, but something I wanted to do for showcase
more than anything. The main thing was that the cases were just repurposed room sensor cases, and because of this, the holes on the box
didn't quite line up, which on one of the boxes was blocking one of the sensor pads on the CO2 sensor. So I redesigned the cases to have
slightly different holes on the front, as well as the box stating "CO2" on the top of the box. I also widened the hole for the charging port
so that it would work with the resoldered boards, since they were slightly different than the room sensor boards.
