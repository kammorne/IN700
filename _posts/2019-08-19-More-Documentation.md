# More Documentation

With a new week starts a new sprint. We decided what everyone was going to do for the next sprint, and I was assigned to help with more documentation,
So I began with documenting the setup process of our new RAK gateways that we recieved. We also setup the devices to work with the Things Network.
After that, we decided it would be a great idea to move all our devices to the Things Network, so we made a plan, however we're going to do it slowly and
not rush it, otherwise we might encounter some issues.

Henry ended up helping me with some of the documentation, since he knew a lot more about setting up the Raspberry Pi's that the devices were running on.
After the documentation was complete, Bee ended up going through it with one of the gateways that wasn't set up yet, to test if the documentation was understandable.
