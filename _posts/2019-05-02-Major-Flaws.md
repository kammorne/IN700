# Major Flaws

Martin gave me a hand with getting the data passed into the website today, and while doing so helped point out a major flaw
with the method I was using to get the information from MongoDB to the website. After talking to him and optimizing the loading of the
data, the loading times for getting to a certain page dropped from 5 minutes to less than 3 seconds. So all in all, I'm very happy that
I got this part of the site working, which helps towards having a working application to display at the end of the semester, even if the
end result isn't loaded with functionality.
