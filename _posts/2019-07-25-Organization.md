# Organizing the Project

We got together today to start deciding what we wanted to work on this semester. Henry came up with the idea that we should focus on completing some
of the projects we already had, such as the ongoing Orokonui project, since it had been a couple years since it had been started. We also looked at
getting other projects, like the PolyKids project underway, since that didn't get much attention last semester, and it shows. Unfortunately, for that
project, we may need to completely restart it. We also began looking at the Orokonui Web App, and after a quick look around, we discovered that there is
absolutely no documentation regarding the Web App at all. Thanks James.

Josh and I ended up digging into the VM that was running the Orokonui Web App, to see if we could figure out anything about how the app is running, and what
the app ran off of, since it definitely wasn't the same as the Data Web App I was working on last semester. After spending a good 1 1/2 hours digging into the VM,
Josh and I finally figured out where the app was located, and how to stop, start and reboot the app. We began to document whatever we found, so that we can at least
get back to where we were.
