# Reformatting Continues

Continued work on reformatting the data from the database onto the webapp. I've managed to get information back onto the webpage after reformatting how the data is loaded from the database into the app itself, but however,
I'm only currently getting one result when I load the page, so I'm trying different methods on getting the data onto the page now.
After working with it for a little while longer, I have the data loading to the page, however it is only the latest result from each node, rather than every single reading from the nodes. I'll continue to look at this later,
as I've run out of time for it right now.
I've also sent Fletcher some information regarding the MQTT website I created earlier in the semester, since he wanted to add the information to the BIT IoT Project page.
