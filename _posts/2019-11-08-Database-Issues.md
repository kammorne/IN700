# Database Issues

Just a quick update, Unfortunately, it seems our Virtual Machine that's hosting our MariaDB database is having issues with connectivity, where
it's not allowing us to either SSH into the VM itself, or connect to the VM via phpmyadmin. I've brought the issue up with the Dev Ops team about
it, and they said they shall look into it.
