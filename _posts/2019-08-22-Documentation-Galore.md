# Documentation Galore

So today I ended up finishing the RAK gateway documentation, which was missing a few bits. I also got Henry to help out with some of the
documentation since he knew what he was doing with the Raspberry Pi setup. After this, I ended up going through and creating the missing
documentation for the Orokonui Web App, since James left us absolutely nothing regarding the web app. So I began digging about and researching
how to run a local version of a django web app through apache. In the end I figured out how the app worked, but I did need to change some files
since the local version wouldn't load any of the CSS formatting if it was using the production settings.
