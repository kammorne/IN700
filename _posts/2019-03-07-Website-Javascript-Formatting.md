#Website Formatting with Javascript

I ended up spending today tinkering on the formatting of the website, because I had it only decoding the information from the sensor, and the formatting on that was readable, but
it wasn't what I was after. After doing some tinkering on the JS side of the website, I had the data being split into 3 different parts, which I then could format to fit the style
I was going for on the website. I also talked to Martin about getting a repository set up on GitLab so that we could host the website online, and so that the other team members could
access it themselves if they wanted to use it for their own nodes.
