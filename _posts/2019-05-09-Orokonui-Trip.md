# Orokonui Trip

Whole team went to Orokonui Ecosanctuary today, to test out the functionality of the gate sensors and to test the GPS range of the devices to the gateway, which was going to be connected
at the workshop area of the Ecosanctuary. We ended up going throughout the area, looking at what they had currently for the gates, and seeing if our devices would be easily installed into them,
or if we would have to do some retrofitting onto the gates. We also got to see a Kiwi, which one of the staff had collected from a roosting box to quickly show us, which was cool.
Unfortunately, I did have to leave sooner than the rest of the team to make it to my other class, so when I left they were just setting up the gateway for the server.
