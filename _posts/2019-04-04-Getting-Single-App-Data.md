# Getting A Single App's Data

Continued work with the database webapp, formatting the information on the screen. I finally got it formatted and closed the ticket for getting the data onto the webapp. However, That opened other tickets for me such
as getting the all_data page working, since I could only get the data on the page if you entered a node's name.
