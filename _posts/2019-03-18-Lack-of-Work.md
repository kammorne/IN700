#Lack of Work

Had a scrum regarding the way the whole group was heading. Apparently it was looking like the team wasn't doing much, as we weren't really commiting to gitlab, so there wasn't much evidence on
what we were actually doing, apart from actually seeing what we were working on. We discussed how the server was sending and receiving data.
