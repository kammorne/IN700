# Negotiation of User Stories

Talked with Martin about organizing a few more User stories for the data webapp. In the end we agreed on a few which would help the app greatly,
as well as bring the app to be more of a central user location regarding the nodes. Adon gave us some good ideas regarding charts, and having
the ability as a user to assign keys to their own nodes, and then be able to view their nodes and the data they're sending.

Adon also brought up the idea of logging in/signing up to the website via google authentication/facebook login. This would allow the user to use their
gmail login instead of creating an entire new account.
