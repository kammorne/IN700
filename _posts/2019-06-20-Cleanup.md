# Cleanup

Final Day of Project, and the final time we get to clean up our files and fix any lingering bugs, like the one I've encountered with
hosting the webapp. Unfortunately, it's been hosted locally through the VM, so technically it isn't live unless my computer has a live
connection to the VM and is running the app that way. I've been in contact with the Dev Ops team and looked up online different ways to get
the app live without needing a session running to have it live.

One of the options I've looked up, but haven't had much success with yet is implementing apache onto the VM, which will allow a live version
to be running on the server without a session connection. However, it hasn't gone well and throws a lot of errors, so I'm looking for different
solutions.
