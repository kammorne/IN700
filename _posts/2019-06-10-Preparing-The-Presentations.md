# Preparing the Presentations

Today we got together and continued organizing the showcase presentations and what we needed to do for it. We needed to decide what we could
showcase that would actually be new and exciting for anyone looking about, since most of this semester was working on previously created nodes,
fixing the errors they had and making sure they were working without any future problems. We created a few tickets on the board, as reminders on
what needs to be completed for the showcase. We've also created one of the tickets as a "Todo List", which we can refer to for the showcase.
