# Learning To Solder

So Today, I got to learn how to solder the boards for the CO2 sensors we were designing. I had done soldering very little in the past,
and not really with boards, but only connecting 2 wires together (Note: It didn't exactly look great, but it did at least provide a connection.)
So really it was a good learning experience to actually learn how to solder a board up. Unfortunately, we didn't get the luxury of having all the
wires neatly hidden under the board like with the temperature sensors, since apparently we were unable to de-solder the CO2 board and be able to
easily attach it to the breadboard itself. The solution to this was to just cut the existing wires, then solder them to the correct locations on
the breadboard so that it would connect to the Adafruit Feather board. After much shaking and messed up solders, I finally managed to produce
something that could be passed as a CO2 Sensor, even though it didn't look too appealing.

After that was sorted, I volunteered to help Callum with the boxes for the CO2 sensors, he had a design in the works, but I offered the option of
using the same boxes that the Temperature sensors used. My reasoning was "If it fits, why bother spending time creating something completely original"
So I went and set up one of the printers to print one of the temperature sensor boxes. It was going to be a 3 hour print, so I decided to leave it running,
and I would check in on it the next day.

Unfortunately, the first print didn't end up printing correctly, leaving me with this result:
