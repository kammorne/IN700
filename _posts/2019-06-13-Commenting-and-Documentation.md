# Commenting
Went Through both the App.py and the Scripts.js files today to comment them, since it's all good and well me knowing how to use the app and
knowing how the application works, but once we start getting new people in (especially since we're nearing the end of the semester), Having
proper commenting and documentation regarding the application is a must so that the new people can understand how to use the web app.

# Documentation
Martin wanted me to go ahead and create some documentation for the web app, which seemed like an easy task, and to be fair it was. I can't
really think of anything to add to the Documentation at the current point in time, apart from how to launch the app if it's turned off.
Even the bit of information I've added seems like a short bit of information, however it's got about as much detail I can fit in without
making the documentation condesending and pointing out the basics in using a computer.

I'm sure once we start getting the exciting things on the app like Google Authentication, Authorizing new nodes, and more, The Documentation
will contain a lot more information regarding those, but at the current point in time,I'm going to have to leave it as is.
