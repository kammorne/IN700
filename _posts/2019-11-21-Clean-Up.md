# Clean Up

Not much regarding actual work today, we just did small bits of clean up work regarding any of the devices we've been working on the semester,
before starting to move the desks and computers to the new location in the project room for showcase. The plan was to have an 'L' shape of
desks with 6 monitors showing the different webapps and slideshows, and then have the devices on the table with little descriptions next to
them. We'd also have the projector displaying a video of us working at Orokonui.

Courtesy of Henry, we've got an image here of the intended layout:
