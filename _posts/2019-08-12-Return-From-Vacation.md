# Return From Vacation

So due to an error in booking everything, I ended up taking a holiday a bit later than the scheduled polytech break. Although today I finally returned
after 2 weeks. Josh gave me the run-down on everything that had happened since I left, and I ended up spending today looking over documentation, since
I was still jetlagged.

Halfway through the class, some clients from the Design School came in, asking for more of the ultrasonic bin sensors that the team was prototyping while
I was away. In the end, Martin (from the Design School) asked for an extra 3 sensors, so I ended up helping build one of them. After a short amount of time
however, we discovered that we didn't have enough components to complete all 4 sensors that Martin wanted, since we only had 2 DFPlayer modules. So
we began looking at different compromises, such as having 2 different sensors connected to 1 arduino board.
Since then, it turns out Rob has a few DFPlayer modules available, so we'll end up using those.
