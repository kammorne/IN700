# Returning to Project

Another semester begins, and only Henry and myself are left from the previous team. At first, it didn't look too good with how big the team was
going to turn out, but luckily, we managed to get a few people interested in the IoT Project, especially since it's evolved from just working on
the nodes. By the end of class, we managed to convince 4 others to join our project, bringing the team to a reasonable 6 people, who all semeed
interested in learning different aspects of the IoT Team, rather than all being interested in the nodes.
