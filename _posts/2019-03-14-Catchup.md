#Catching Up On Lost Time

Had to play a bit of catchup after losing some time to being sick earlier in the week. So today I continued working on the website for Linus, mostly debugging with the node we were getting
to send the data via MQTT on, since it kept dropping packets for some reason.

As it turned out in the end, it was something to do with some of the backend code I had written, and after a bit of tinkering, it worked fine.
