# Navigation of Nodes

Continued work on the all data page and the navigation for the page. I've got a navbar working currently however I'm not sure if I like the look of it
and may change the style of it later, possibly changing it to a sidebar instead, which may work better for user accessibility.

I've actually changed my mind, and I've stuck with the navbar staying at the top. It's functional for what it is currently, and it allows the user to easily
access the other nodes quickly, rather than having to type in the name of the node.
