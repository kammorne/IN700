# Formatting All Node Data

Added some nicer formatting to the node data page, giving a cleaner look to the tables. I've also added the option to toggle the
visibility of certain nodes, allowing a user to see information for multiple nodes they wish to see.

I've also removed the original formatting I was using for the table, which seemed very basic in terms of styling. I've since changed the
formatting of the table to the formatting provided by the bootstrap theme I'm using for the website. This has changed the style of the
page to be a lot more clean and readable, and also makes the site look like it isn't stuck in the early 2000s.
