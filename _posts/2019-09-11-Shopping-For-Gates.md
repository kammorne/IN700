# Shopping For Gate Pieces

So today, since I didn't have any classes, I decided to go look at getting some parts for some prototype gates at Mitre 10. I already had some
pallets at home to work with to create the gates themselves, however I wanted to get some hardware so that we could test the gate functionality.

I made my way down to Mitre 10, and had a look at the different latches for different gates. However, I saw the prices for some of the latches,
and decided that I wouldn't grab them at this time. I ended up contacting Martin on slack asking if we would be able to put the latches on the
polytechnic's budget, instead of my own.
