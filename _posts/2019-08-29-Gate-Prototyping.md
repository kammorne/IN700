# Gate Prototyping

So today I was giving a hand to Bee, who was working on the prototype gate sensor she had created. I gave her a hand with testing some of the
components, since they weren't working correctly. We found out that it was a simple grounding issue, but then we started to delve into adjusting
the gate's button, since we saw that the button did not need that much travel to change the signal. So we changed the location of the button to be
closer to the fence, which allowed the button to still work, however the gate didn't need as much effort to close it enough for the latch to lock
the gate.
