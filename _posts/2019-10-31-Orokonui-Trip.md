# Orokonui Trip

Oh boy, here we go, the big day. Today we *Finally* get to deploy one of the gate sensors, a project that's been in development for 3 years now,
and we finally take the giant leap towards finally finishing the project. Now that being said, the project still has a lot of work to go towards
it, so I'm not expecting it to be done within the first week of next semester, that would be ridiculous.

So, we made our way out to Orokonui early this morning, and got ourselves sorted out. Bee was the full team player, arriving early at the polytech
to make sure we had absolutely everything we needed, and that turned out to be great once we got there, because there wasn't a time where we stopped
and went "Oh bugger, we've left that behind". When we first arrived, Josh had his vendetta to sort out, by making sure that the Antenna up at the shed
was properly secured, and while he was at it, made sure it was slightly higher to help with getting a signal from the gates.

Once the antenna was sorted, We made our way down towards the first gate, aptly named orokonui1 on the sensor, and began work on installing the new
device onto the post next to the gate.

The job went quickly, and we were soon done with the first gate, having it connectly and secured to the post. We weren't sure if the gate was going to
be sending data yet, so we made our way back to the shed to set up the gateway, and then test to see if we got any packets.

There was a bit of a panic at the shed as we realised there wasn't really a way to connect to the gateway, but after some searching about and talking to
staff members, we got the WiFi password, and Josh was able to SSH into the gateway. Henry took over, and adjusted some settings for the Gateway to change it
from the LoRa network over to TheThingsNetwork, since we had changed over to using that back at the polytech. Soon enough, we had the Gateway online, and we
then had to check if the gate was working correctly.

In the end, Henry and I made our way back down to the gate with some walkie-talkies, and tested the gate, and we soon got the call that the gate
was in fact sending data, Success!
