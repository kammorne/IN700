#Dawn of the Database Webapp

Martin ended up bringing up an idea for a "Database Webapp", which would be able to host the information from all of the nodes we've made, and display it to be able to look through it easily.
Since I'm into the web side of things in the group, I decided to take on the challenge, and began putting a simple HTML site together.
