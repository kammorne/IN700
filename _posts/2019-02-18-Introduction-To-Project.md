# Introduction to Project

Didn't really achieve anything this class. It was essentially a get to know what's going on with the class this semester and get our computers organized.
Adon did give us the task of figuring out what we want to do for project this semester, and said that we should pick one that we would like to do, but also
have an extra one organized for the event where our selected project isn't available.
