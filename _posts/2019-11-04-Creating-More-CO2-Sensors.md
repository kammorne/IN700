# Creating More CO2 Sensors

So today, I decided to give a hand sorting out the other CO2 Sensors, since they were still in their prototype design with just the connected
wires going straight to the Adafruit board. I also organized another set of cases to be printed off for the new sensors too.

There wasn't much trouble sorting out the board this time, and it was a good time to learn more about soldering and get the solder points to be
a lot better than what they were on the first board I ended up soldering.
