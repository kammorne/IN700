# Mongo Connection

Finally caught up with Isabel today, and she showed me how to connect to the MongoDB database, and retrieve information from it. Afterwards, I finally managed to get a connection working, and I had the information
from the database reading into a console readout, which is a huge step towards the first ticket for the data webapp. I've begun tinkering with passing the data through to the website I've got, and I managed to get
all of the data actually on the page, although without formatting.
