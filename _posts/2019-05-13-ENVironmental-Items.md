# ENVironmental Items

Today I got the .ENV file working for the webapp, which has helped optimize my workflow with the webapp. I've also managed to limit the amount of entries going into the frontend from the backend. So I'm now going to work on
fixing the decoding error I'm getting with the frontend Javascript...

And it's done! I've finally managed to get the data to show on the website. Although currently you can't search for a single device. I've started a new ticket to begin my work on getting the information
for a single device to show, and once I can get that functionality working again, I can add a searchbar/dropdown list for our devices to search for this again.
